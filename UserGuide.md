## User Story 1: Detection of inappropriate words

***As an instructor, I want the system to automatically detect and flag inappropriate words, so that the community stays respectful and focused.***

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1- The system checks each word in a user's post or reply against a predefined dictionary of inappropriate words.

2- If an inappropriate word is detected, the word is replaceed with asterisks. 

**How to test this feature:** 

1- Log into NodeBB

2- Choose one of the categories by clicking on one of them

5- If the word is in our dictionary of bad words, it will get censored and look like this:

**Automated testing:** 

**Location:** The tests for the inappropriate words feature are located in test/posts.js. The actual tests can be found between lines 56 and 92.

**What is Being Tested:** the tests added focus on ensuring that the inappropriate words feature works correctly by censoring offensive language in the user posts.

The first test sets up a mock bad words list and verifies that the censorBadWords function replaces these words with asterisks in the content.

The second test handles content with no bad words. It confirms that when the censorBadWords function is called on clean content, the text remains unchanged, e.g., "This is a clean test"

The third test deals with special characters and mixed-case bad words (e.g., "This is a BadWord1! and badword2"). It checks that bad words are censored regardless of their case or punctuation, returning the correct censored version of the content.

**Why the Tests are Sufficient:** The tests thoroughly cover all key aspects of the inappropriate words filtering feature. The first test ensures that the censoring mechanism functions as intended by replacing offensive words with asterisks, validating the core functionality. The second test confirms that clean content remains unchanged, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of user posts that do not contain offensive language. The third test addresses edge cases, such as handling special characters and mixed-case bad words, ensuring that inappropriate content is caught regardless of variations in punctuation or capitalization. These tests cover the full spectrum of expected use cases, providing confidence that the feature will perform reliably in different scenarios.

## User Story 2: Anonymous posts

***As a user, I want the option to post anonymously to my instructors so that I can express my concerns openly without fear of repercussions.***

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1- The frontend should display an anonymous posting checkbox option, allowing users to submit posts without revealing their identity.

2- Ensure both backend and frontend integration to mask the user's identity while maintaining proper functionality of the post submission and display process.

**How to test this feature:**

1- On the NodeBB homepage, click on the "General Discussion" category (or any other relevant category where you want to post).

<img width="1243" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 10 18 20 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea764fb0-583e-48dd-863e-5506b0d5f689">


2- Once inside the chosen category, locate and click the "New Topic" button, usually found at the top or bottom of the page.

<img width="1238" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 10 21 31 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19860cf2-ea51-45a5-b966-036023bf1554">


3- In the new topic form, look for the Anonymous checkbox located next to the Title input box. Click on the checkbox to enable anonymous posting.

Fill in the Title and Content of your post as usual. You can also attach files or add formatting if needed.

4- After writing your post, click the Submit button to post it anonymously. Your post will now appear in the thread, and your identity will be hidden.

<img width="1231" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 10 23 45 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6407c269-eb96-48c0-a5a5-75ec9539ae7d">
<img width="1230" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 10 24 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c6c39b5-4ece-4624-9d99-1a7d7faffe14">

**Note:** You can also use the anonymous posting feature to reply to existing topics or posts. Simply click the Reply button within any topic, check the Anonymous checkbox, and submit your reply anonymously. However, in this scenario, we are demonstrating the process for creating a new topic.

**Automated testing:** 

**Location:** The tests for the anonymous feature are located in test/topics.js. The relevant tests can be found between lines 2504 and 2560.

**What is Being Tested:** The tests added focus on ensuring that the anonymous posting feature works correctly in the forum.

The first test checks that when a new post is created with the anonymous flag set to false, the post is linked to the correct user and is not anonymous. It verifies the post’s metadata to ensure the correct user information is displayed.

The second test verifies that when a post is created with the anonymous flag set to true, the post correctly hides the user's identity. It checks that the post is marked as anonymous in the database and that the anonymous flag remains true when the post is fetched.

**Why the Tests are Sufficient:** These tests cover the core functionality of the anonymous feature, ensuring that the system correctly handles both anonymous and non-anonymous posts. By validating the behavior of the anonymous flag in different scenarios, these tests ensure that the user’s identity is appropriately masked or revealed depending on their choice. The tests also account for proper storage of this data in the database, making them comprehensive for the feature.


## User Story 3: Emoji Reactions in Chat Section

***As a user, I want to react to messages in the chat with a range of emojis to quickly express emotions and reactions without typing a response.***

**Status:** Incomplete

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1- The task will be considered complete when the backend successfully tracks and stores emoji reactions for chat messages.

2- The feature must be seamlessly integrated with the existing chat structure and support multiple reactions per message. 

3- The task will be considered complete when all emojis are available in the chat reaction system.

**Progress:** We were only able to complete the frontend implementation of the emoji chat feature for this user story.

<img width="289" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 10 13 18 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3454b07-4a31-4bf8-96e3-152ffdf798c4">

**Justification:** While working on the backend logic for emoji reactions, we faced challenges with socket programming, which required real-time synchronization of reactions across multiple users in a chat room. This task involved advanced socket handling techniques beyond my current expertise. Additionally, integrating the emoji reactions into the existing chat system was more complex than expected due to dependencies on real-time updates and performance optimization across different browsers. Although we were able to implement the foundational parts of the feature, including the API endpoint and core logic for handling reactions, the complexity and scope of the task were too large to complete within a single sprint.

## User Story 4: Pre-defined Replies

***As a user, I want to be able to quickly respond to messages by clicking buttons with predefined replies so that I don't waste time typing out responses that are common.***

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1- The task will be complete when a clickable button is added to the user interface beside the regular reply button.

2- Clicking any of the predefined quick reply buttons results in the corresponding message being inserted into the quick reply text box. 

3- The existing file containing the buttons for replying and quick replying must be identified and integrated with the new feature.

**How to test this feature:**

1- Login to Nodebb.

2- Choose any message you would like to respond to. You should see a quick reply button at the bottom of the page, along with the other suggested responses.

3- Select a suggested response to reply to the message,it should automatically be inserted into the quick reply text box. Then click on the quick reply button to post your message.

**Automated testing:** Automated testing is not ideal for this feature as it is purely frontend, involving simple button clicks to insert predefined text into the reply box. Since no complex logic or backend interaction is required, manual testing is sufficient to verify the functionality.
